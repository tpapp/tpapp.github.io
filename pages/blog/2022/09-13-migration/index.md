# Migration from Hugo to Franklin.jl

After a long break, I am restarting my blog. In addition to personal reasons, the main reason I did not keep it up is that I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a bit difficult to work with: updates to Hugo required updates to my setup, and integration with Julia was less than ideal. I have now switched to [Franklin.jl](https://franklinjl.org/).

I do not have the time to convert all my earlier posts, they remain available in [this directory](../../../../post/). I hope that this will keep old links working, if there is a problem please let me know and I will try to fix it.
